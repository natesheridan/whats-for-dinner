What's for Dinner 
Solo Project

Contributors: Nate Sheridan


What's For Dinner is an web-app that answers the age old question that is asked daily - "Whats for dinner". When using the page, you are greeted with a radio based form that asks you what type of meal you want? From there you can hit lets cook and find something good to eat tonight. Using links in the results pane you can easily search google for a recipe and find your favorite one. The website is responsive and can be viewed on mobile, tablet and large form factor screens using flexboxes in CSS, It has error handling and a fail safe to notify users on misclick of radios.
